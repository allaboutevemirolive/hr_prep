    for i in range(len(s)):
        if bool(
            1-int(s[i]) ^ int(t[i])
        ):
            res += '0';

The provided code defines a function named `strings_xor` that takes two input strings `s` and `t` as arguments and performs an XOR operation character-wise between the two strings. Here's how the code works:

1. The `strings_xor` function is defined with parameters `s` and `t`.

2. The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string. It will store the result of the XOR operation.

3. The code enters a `for` loop that iterates over the indices of the strings `s` and `t`. It assumes that `s` and `t` have the same length, as they are expected to represent binary strings of equal size.

4. For each index `i`, the code performs the XOR operation between the characters at index `i` of `s` and `t`.

5. The XOR operation is performed using the bitwise XOR operator `^`. `int(s[i])` and `int(t[i])` are used to convert the characters at index `i` of `s` and `t` into integers.

6. The result of the XOR operation is then converted to a boolean value using `1-int(...)`. This step ensures that the result is either 0 or 1.

7. The `bool(...)` function is called to convert the integer result to a boolean value.

8. An `if` statement checks if the boolean result is `True`. If it is, meaning the XOR operation resulted in 1, the code appends '0' to the `res` string using `res += '0'`.

9. If the boolean result is `False`, indicating that the XOR operation resulted in 0, the code appends '1' to the `res` string using `res += '1'`.

10. After the loop completes, the `res` string contains the XOR result of the two input strings `s` and `t`.

11. The `strings_xor` function returns the final result stored in `res`.

12. Outside the function, the code prompts the user to input two strings `s` and `t`.

13. The `strings_xor` function is called with `s` and `t` as arguments, and the result is printed using `print(strings_xor(s, t))`.

In summary, this code takes two binary strings as input, performs an XOR operation character-wise between the strings, and returns the result as a new string. The XOR operation is implemented using the `^` operator, and the result is stored in `res` by appending '0' or '1' based on the XOR outcome.
