The code you provided calculates the absolute difference between the sums of the two diagonals of a square 2D array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The function `diagonalDifference` takes a reference to a 2D array `arr` as input and returns an integer.

2. It initializes the variable `n` to the length of the array `arr`, assuming it is a square matrix.

3. It initializes `diag1` and `diag2` to 0. These variables will be used to store the sums of the elements in the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal, respectively.

4. It enters a loop that iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

5. For each index `i`, it adds the element at position `(i, i)` to `diag1`. This corresponds to summing the elements along the main diagonal.

6. It adds the element at position `(i, n-1-i)` to `diag2`. This corresponds to summing the elements along the secondary diagonal.

7. After the loop finishes, it calculates the absolute difference between `diag1` and `diag2` using the `.abs()` method.

8. The resulting diagonal difference is returned from the function.

The code effectively iterates over the 2D array and accumulates the sums of the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal. It then calculates the absolute difference between these two sums, representing the diagonal difference, and returns it as the result.

I still didn't understand how this line works

`diag2 += arr[i][n - 1 - i];`





Let's break down the line `diag2 += arr[i][n - 1 - i];` and explain how it works:

1. `arr` is a 2D array, represented as a slice of vector slices (`&[Vec<i32>]`).

2. `i` represents the index of the current row within the outer loop.

3. `n` represents the length of the square matrix, which is the number of rows or columns.

4. The expression `n - 1 - i` calculates the index of the element along the secondary diagonal.

   - `n - 1` represents the last index of each row. Since array indices are 0-based, this expression gives the index of the last element in the row.

   - Subtracting `i` from `n - 1` effectively moves the index towards the beginning of the row as `i` increases in the outer loop. This allows us to access the elements along the secondary diagonal.

5. `arr[i][n - 1 - i]` accesses the element in the current row `i` at the calculated index `n - 1 - i`.

   - It accesses the element along the secondary diagonal corresponding to the current row.

6. The value of `arr[i][n - 1 - i]` is added to `diag2` using the compound assignment operator `+=`.

   - This accumulates the sum of the elements along the secondary diagonal.

7. The outer loop iterates through each row, and for each row, the corresponding element along the secondary diagonal is added to `diag2`.

8. Once the loop finishes, `diag2` will contain the sum of the elements along the secondary diagonal.

By accessing the elements at the positions determined by `arr[i][n - 1 - i]`, the code effectively sums up the values along the secondary diagonal of the 2D array. This line of code contributes to calculating the diagonal sums required to compute the diagonal difference.
