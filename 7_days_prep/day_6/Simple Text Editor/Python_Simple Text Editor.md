        # save copy
        history.append(copy(s))
        del s[-k:]
    
    # print a specific character from the text
    elif op[0] == '3':
        k = int(op[1])
        print(s[k-1])

    elif op[0] == '4':
        s = history.pop()
```

The provided code implements a simple text editor that supports several operations. Let's go through the code and understand how it works.

1. `no_ops = int(input())`: This line reads an integer `no_ops` from the input, which represents the number of operations to perform.

2. `ops = []`: This line initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations.

3. `for i in range(no_ops):`: This loop iterates `no_ops` times and performs the following steps for each iteration:

   - `one_op = input().split(' ')`: This line reads a string `one_op` from the input and splits it by spaces. It represents a single operation with its arguments.
   
   - `ops.append(one_op)`: This line adds the `one_op` to the `ops` list, storing the operation and its arguments as a list.
   
4. `from copy import copy`: This line imports the `copy` function from the `copy` module. It will be used later for undoing operations.

5. `history = []`: This line initializes an empty list `history` to store the history of states of the text.

6. The following loop iterates over each operation in `ops` and performs the specified operation:

   - `if op[0] == '1':`: If the first element of the operation list `op` is `'1'`, it means the operation is to append a string to the text.
   
     - `to_append = op[1]`: This line extracts the second element of `op`, which represents the string to append.
     
     - `history.append(copy(s))`: This line makes a copy of the current state of the text `s` and appends it to the `history` list.
     
     - `s.extend(to_append)`: This line extends the text `s` by appending the `to_append` string to it.
   
   - `elif op[0] == '2':`: If the first element of the operation list `op` is `'2'`, it means the operation is to delete characters from the text.
   
     - `k = int(op[1])`: This line extracts the second element of `op` and converts it to an integer. It represents the number of characters to delete.
     
     - `history.append(copy(s))`: This line makes a copy of the current state of the text `s` and appends it to the `history` list.
     
     - `del s[-k:]`: This line deletes the last `k` characters from the text `s` by using list slicing.
   
   - `elif op[0] == '3':`: If the first element of the operation list `op` is `'3'`, it means the operation is to print a specific character from the text.
   
     - `k = int(op[1])`: This line extracts the second element of `op` and converts it to an integer. It represents the index of the character to print.
     
     - `print(s[k-1])`: This line prints the character at index `k-1` from the text `s`. Note that indexing starts from 1, so we subtract 1 to get the correct index.
   
   - `elif op[0] == '4':`: If the first element of the operation list `op` is `'4'`, it means the operation is to undo the last operation.
   
     - `s = history.pop()`: This line retrieves the last state of the text from the `history` list and assigns it back to `s`, effectively undoing the last operation.

The code executes the operations based on the input and produces the corresponding output. It supports appending to the text, deleting characters, printing characters, and undoing operations.
